# GitHub Contribution Checker App

People :heart: GitHub Contributions. However, it's not always simple to tell why a commit isn't [counted as a contribution][contributions].

This app lets you authenticate with GitHub and check whether a specific commit qualifies as a contribution, by using the [contribution-checker][contribution-checker] library.
